 I'm building a business called Widgets Incorporated. We are solving the problem of widgets being too leaky and allowing water to seep into vehicles who have old technology widgets. We do this using an exciting new technology which uses a patented membrane to stop the flow of moisture around the widgets border. This technology is unique and my co-founder Frank Perkins is the inventor of it. He's serving as our company's CTO. Our chief of operations is a fellow named Jeremy Whites and the three of us have worked together building another company that was sold to Ford Motor Company for a substantial amount. So we're not first time founders and we have experience working together. In our free time we enjoy road biking. I'm a competitor in many road bike racing events. This product I think is relevant right now because the global warming effects cause more rain to be falling in higher amounts and that means that all vehicles are going to need greater protection from moisture. So the timing I think is exactly right. We currently have four customers on our wait list and one customer actually in production. The customer that's in production is Toyota and the four others are Ford, General Motors, Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz.
